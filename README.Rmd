# truelies

`truelies` implements Bayesian methods, described in 
[Hugh-Jones (2019)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40881-019-00069-x), 
for estimating the proportion of liars in coinflip-style experiments, where
subjects report a random outcome and are paid for reporting a "good" outcome.

For R source for the original paper, see https://github.com/hughjonesd/GSV-comment.

## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("hughjonesd/truelies")
```

## Example

If you have 33 out of 50 reports of heads in a coin flip experiment:

```{r example}
library(truelies)
d1 <- update_prior(heads = 33, N = 50, P = 0.5, prior = dunif)
plot(d1)

dist_mean(d1)

# 95% confidence interval, using hdrcde
dist_hdr(d1, 0.95)
```
